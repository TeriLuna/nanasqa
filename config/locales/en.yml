# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

If you are looking for a place with friendly atmosphere, open-minded people, and you like to dance - this is a place to go to! There are not many hostels like this one. Full of art, good vibes and music. Roy is a very generous host. You might have a problem to leave ;)"'
    fosca_work_away_member: '"Great experience !! For starters, Roy is a wonderful person ... thoughtful, outgoing and very flexible! That makes working in the hostel never tiresome and there is a way to get to know Nasca and its surroundings with ease (also thanks to the advice provided by Roy, who knows a lot about his land !!). The atmosphere at home is always relaxed and very happy, the comics are rich and the weather is warm .... I could only stay a week due to lack of time, but why go ?!??"'
    erica_work_away_member: '"I left my heart in this beautiful place! It is friendly and chilly! Work is easy and amazing! And it is possible to visit many incredible places. Roy is a great person, always happy and really kind, with a lots of positive energy. It has been an unforgettable experience! Thanks for evrything :blush:"'
    theres_philip_work_away_member: '"We had a really great time at Royâ€™s hostel! Unfortunately we could only stay for one week. The work was pretty easy and made a lot of fun! Roy and the other volunteers we stayed with were all very friendly and funny! We did a lot of things together and enjoyed it every day! Nice place to be!!"'

Many of us came to Nasca wanting to know the lines that everyone talks about, and continue on our way, but when you find the best Hostel in the whole city, and you meet Roy, everything changes and you want to make Nasca your new home, so The only bad thing that could happen to you is that you change your plans and stay for a month or two living this experience! I will never forget!"'

In addition, we were always safe and welcomed with our dog without any problem."'
    enrique_booking_member: '"The value for money, I was making a trip from Arequipa to Lima about 1000 KM. and an intermediate point to rest is Nazca, the good thing that the hotel accepted pets, that is why we chose to choose it and I do not regret it exceeds my expectations. Large room, had two bathrooms for being a quadruple, excellent cleaning and friendly and personalized service."'
    bisbal_booking_member: '"I could make my own breakfast in the kitchen comfortably. They gave me all the facilities for my bike (they lent me a chain to secure it to the car) and my cat (they lent me a strong scotch for her diaper heh heh) Roy is super helpful."'

    patricia_airbnb_member: '"I was actually very spontaneously going to Nazca and I booked a room at the Hostel of Roy when I was on the bus from Lima to Nazca. I did not really care where to stay and booked a double room with ensuite bathroom. Actually it turns out this was the best choice I could make! Very nice and clean double room with a nice bathroom and HOT water!!! Breakfast is not included but for S15 you get fruits, eggs, bread, butter and jam and tea. The people hanging out at the hostel were very friendly and it feels like you arrive and stay in a family house. So all in all a great experience! If I go back to Nazca will definitely come back! Thank you Roy :))"'
    lee_airbnb_member: '"Roy s place is fantastic! It is new and clean and we met lots of good people there. It was so nice to have our own double room with comfy bed and pillows and a private bathroom! You can walk to and from the bus station and even book a Nazca Lines tour with Roy. You do not even have to walk to the shop for beers as they have a fridge full of them for cheap! And for you ladies out there: a great hairdryer!"'
